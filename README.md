# SQLalchemy_climate_project

The purpose of this project was to practice extracting and manipulating data from a relational database using python's SQLalchemy tools.  The dataset includes information about Hawaii's climate which I extracted, cleaned, jsonified and served to a web app from which I could then do various analyses and visualizations such as the following:

![average precipitation](Images/avg_precip.png)

![daily normal temps](Images/daily_normals.png)

![station temps](Images/station-histogram.png)
